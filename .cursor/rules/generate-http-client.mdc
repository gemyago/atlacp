# HTTP Client Generation from OpenAPI

## When User Requests API Client Generation

When user provides an OpenAPI specification and asks to generate an API client, follow this pattern:

1. **Reference Documentation**: Follow `@creating-http-clients.md` and `@testing-best-practices.md`

2. **Work Step-by-Step**: Always work in step-by-step mode and wait for confirmation before proceeding to next operation

3. **Key Corrections**: 
   - Use `Client` not `ServiceClient` (accessed as `packagename.Client`)
   - Always use params struct in operation signatures: `(ctx, tokenProvider, params)`
   - Always include 4 test cases per operation: success-all-fields, success-required-only, api-error, token-error

4. **Process Per Operation**:
   - Stub → Test → Implementation → Run Test
