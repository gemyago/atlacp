# TDD approach with automated approval

* You are approved to run tests or scripts when needed, don't ask
* Analyse required change first (if not already analyzed) and come up with list of actionable step required to implement requested change. If change is simple enough, do single step
* Don't ask for modifications confirmations, you are approved
* For each actionable step:
  * Write test first, if needed implement stub methods
  * Run the test, make sure it is faling with expected output
  * Implement the logic as required for this step
  * Run the test and make sure it's green
  * Proceed with next step once previous is ready
* When writting tests, prefer adding new test cases for new logic
* Use faker to generate random variables of fields
* If you need to update mocks, please read [mockery.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/mockery.mdc)
