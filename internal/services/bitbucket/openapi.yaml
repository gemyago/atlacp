# Bitbucket Cloud API OpenAPI Specification
#
# Note: Bitbucket Cloud does not provide a single downloadable OpenAPI 3.x specification.
# Their API documentation is available at:
# https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/
#
# The documentation is built using OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger 2.0) but is rendered as web pages
# rather than being available as a downloadable specification file.
#
# For implementation purposes, we will need to:
# 1. Generate client code using existing community tools or 
# 2. Create manual HTTP client implementations based on the documentation
# 3. Use the community-maintained OpenAPI spec from projects like:
#    - https://github.com/magmax/bitbucket-openapi
#
# Base URL: https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0
# Documentation: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/
# 
# TODO: Integrate with community OpenAPI specification or generate HTTP clients manually
